I primarily learned digital marketing skills in my previous position at KME.digital, where SEO/SEM and Google Analytics were a major part of my duties.\n\nI am experienced in designing Adwords campaigns, conducting keyword research, managing social media accounts, and implementing best practices for on and off-site SEO. I am accustomed to conducting extensive research in order to understand an industry, target market, and determine appropriate cost-per-click.\n\n\nAdditionally, I have a strong foundation of political knowledge and a keen interest in current events, having also minored in Government at GMU. I volunteered in the Obama '12 campaign, as well as the Perriello â€™17 campaign.\n\nWhat a load of cobblers cup of tea chuffed marvelous Elementary my dear Watson the black death pulled a right corker, numbskull naff the lakes the black death wellies.
