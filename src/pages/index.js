    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>As a graduate of George Mason University with a BA in Communication, I have professionally paired my education with my natural affinity for technology to find a passion for digital marketing. I primarily learned digital marketing skills in my previous position at KME.digital, where SEO/SEM and Google Analytics were a major part of my duties.

I am experienced in designing Adwords campaigns, conducting keyword research, managing social media accounts, and implementing best practices for on and off-site SEO. I am accustomed to conducting extensive research in order to understand an industry, target market, and determine appropriate cost-per-click.


Additionally, I have a strong foundation of political knowledge and a keen interest in current events, having also minored in Government at GMU. I volunteered in the Obama '12 campaign, as well as the Perriello â€™17 campaign.
